          This was a project that was molded over a time while I was working
          for Nagios Enterprises, LLC and Ayamon, LLC.  The idea was to bring
          the community together in one place and share the collective 
          enthusiasm and talent.  This was a combination blog and wiki.  
          The software used was Wordpress for the blog and Mediawiki for the
          wiki software.  Custom themes were developed for both sites.  Graphics
          and color schemes tied the community sites with the general nagios 
          project.

          <p>
          community.nagios.org and wiki.nagios.org have since been redesigned 
          again as part of a larger rebranding of all nagios websites.

          the forefront.  Using my experience in usability research and 
          web standards I was able to sketch designs that I later turned to 
          photoshop templates.

          The University of Minnesota"s class search and registration system

          one class goes through 3 separate search pages and 1 registration page
          as well as pen and paper to figure out if class times are overlapping.
          As a group project we paper prototyped, user interviewed and tested
          the problem, developed a clean one-window solution, and completed
          a process of implementations and user testings.  The result was a
          simple one-page web solution to search classes and drill down and
          print the schedule.
